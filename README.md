# KISSmetrics.java 

KISSmetrics tracking API wrapper for Java

This is intended as a Java port of the Python [KISSmetrics](https://github.com/kissmetrics/py-KISSmetrics) client.

This is not an officially supported client. 

## Goal

The intent here is to define a client in Java that has no other dependencies other than the JDK. This is why some obvious work is done rewritten when Apache or other libraries may have a more effective or existing class or static method (I'd like to avoid commons-logging, forever). 

## Initial Implementation 

A raw implementation has been provided without proper test unit coverage and without performance test. Test coverage will be provided as soon as possible.
